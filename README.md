Note for email notifications!
To send email on your behalf you must add the file named "config.properties" to the "/app" package,
and write these 2 lines<br>
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your email address
EMAIL_PASSWORD=foreign application password<br>
The same you need to configure the EmailSender.java class with your email server if it is different from GMail.
